* GETTING UP AND RUNNING

Run

  make bootstrap

and it will pull down nginx and the push module and build it.  I'm
downloading and building pcre statically into nginx as well, since
dreamhost doesnt seem to have it, your system might not need it, but
the makefile isnt smart enough to check.

After that, run 

  make start

and you should have a running server on port 8088

* PLAYING WITH THE NEW TOYS

open a web browser to 

  http://localhost:8088/?channel=xyzzy

to see the interactive chat client demo.

run

  curl -d"test message" http://localhost:8088/publish?id=xyzzy

to post messages from the console.  and

  curl http://localhost:8088/activity?id=xyzzy

To tail messages on the console, run 

  python ./listen.py

TODO: the xyzzy channel is hardcoded in that python script... make it
a commandline param
